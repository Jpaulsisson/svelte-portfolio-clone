### Challenges I faced while building this:
  1. Svelte is a good bit different when you've only used React
  2. Building that carousel
  3. Creating a modal from scratch
  4. Handling all the `A11y` errors/warnings to maximize accessability
  5. Getting the nav links to color switch properly using the `$page` object

### Things I'm proud of:
  - It only took me one real day of working to complete this
  - Tailwind is like second nature already
  - I'm crazy proud of that carousel on the `/works` page
  - Catching on to a new framework so easily and quickly made me feel like maybe I understand this coding stuff more than I give myself credit for
  - The color scheme is good on the original and the clone while remaining unique to themselves
